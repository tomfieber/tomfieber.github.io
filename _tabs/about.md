My name is Tom. I'm a father, husband, and retired Army veteran. After I retired, I worked as a penetration tester for a few years before I started gravitating more towards teaching. 

I'm the owner and Chief Learning Officer (ðŸ™„ðŸ¤£) at **Eagle Rising Information Security**. My goal is to provide foundational information security content in an easy to understand way, and in a manner that is accessible to everyone regardless of their current experience level. 

Away from the computer, I enjoy hiking, playing with our pets, and coaching my kids' sports teams.

## My Philosophy

![](../assets/img/about/IMG-20251028080356736.png){: .shadow .rounded-image }

- **Cybersecurity can be learned**. Nobody is born just knowing any of this. If the best in the field could do it, so can we.Â 

  

- Don't feel the need to fit yourself into someone else's learning style. Find what works for **YOU** and stick with it!Â 

  

- **Try to get 1% better every day** and compare your skills today against your skills yesterday. Comparing yourself against others robs us of the joy of learning.

  

- Don't dwell on past mistakes and don't stress about what you'll do in the future. **Just be present and focus on the now**.
