# Broken Access Control Cheatsheet

## Definition of Terms

**Broken Object Level Authorization**
: Being able to see something you shouldn't be able to see

**Broken Functional Level Authorization**
: Being able to do something you shouldn't be able to do

**Insecure Direct Object Reference**
: Kind of an umbrella term

## Checks

- [ ] Understand how the application works
	- How does it fetch/create/modify/delete data?
- [ ] Look for numerical id's in requests
	- URL query string
	- POST body
	- etc.
- [ ] Test with two users and swap ids to see if you can access the other user's data
- [ ] Look for any encrypted/encoded data that may be used to fetch data.
	- Try to understand how it's created and see if we can spoof it
- [ ] Check to see if there is a way to leak the UUID of the other user, if used.
	- Report a user
	- Look at the profile image
	- Any other way of interacting with a user
- [ ] Use a plugin like autorize to help automate testing
- [ ] Can a low user perform admin actions
- [ ] Are boundaries between roles properly enforced?
	- Be sure to check the actual API calls, not just what is in the browser. 
- [ ] Check VERBS besides just GET
	- Particularly in state-changing actions


!!! warning "Important note"

	Not every IDOR/BAC constitutes a security vulnerability. If the only thing leaked is information that is already accessible on the site, then it's not a valid vulnerability. Be sure to carefully review the impact for any IDOR/BAC you identify to make sure that it's an actual vulnerability.
