## About Me

My name is Tom. I'm a husband, father, and grandfather. After I retired from the Army in 2022, I worked as a penetration tester for a few years before gravitating toward teaching. I'm now in the process of getting my own project off the ground. I started **Eagle Rising Information Security** to provide high-quality foundational cybersecurity content to students (or anyone else getting started). My goal is to present information in an easy to understand way, and in a manner which is accessible for anyone, regardless of where they are in their information security journey.

## My Philosophy

![](attachments/index/file-20251124113610407.png)

- **Cybersecurity can be learned**. Nobody is born just knowing all this. 
- Don't try to learn everything all at once. **Try to get 1% better every day**.
- Everyone learns differently. Try to avoid comparing yourself to others. **You don't owe anyone anything**.
- **Find your own flow**.
